# Bowling-Scores-Update
An updated version of writing a program to calculate a bowling league's average bowling scores. You will need to read the input data from the file BowlingScores.txt. The goal here is to take the list of the 10 bowlers and display all their scores from the 5 games, as well as output the average score of each bowler! This time, with a struct, and more void functions.
